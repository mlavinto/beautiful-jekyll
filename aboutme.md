I am Mikko, a [recovering physicist](http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-1262-0) and an [aspiring data scientist](http://www.bigdatapump.com). 

I graduated with a PhD from the University of Helsinki in late 2015. My subject was cosmology, and the topic I was interested in was whether the large-scale structure of universe affects light propagation beyond the first-order approximation, and whether perturbation theory is an accurate way to model the universe as a whole.

Currently I am working as a consultant data scientist, in projects related to data management and analysis in cloud services.
